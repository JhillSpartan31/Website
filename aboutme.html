	<p><h2><center>My full name is Jalen William Hill, I'm named this cause I have two older brothers who have J's as their first letters in their names. The William comes from my grandfather on my dad's side, and the Hill is my dad's last name. In my family I have two brothers one who just grandfather graduated from college and the other who is a sophmore in college. Lastly I have two dogs, a Cockapoo who's name is Marley and a Beagle who's name is Bailey.</p>

	<p> I have two main hobbies which are video games and baseball. I've been playing baseball since I was like 6 years old ,and I've been playing ever since. I also played 9th grade year ,but I was out for most of the season becasue I tore my acl. But one of my other main hobbies is playing video games; I play video games pretty much whenever I can, at home on weekends or breaks I wake up play for like 14 hours then go back to sleep and then repeat.</center></h2> </p>
